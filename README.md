# Boundary Labs

Research focused on identifying smart contract failure modes before deployment.

---

## Focus Areas

- ERC-4337 / Account Abstraction systems
- Smart contract execution risk
- Griefing & denial-of-service vectors
- Protocol failure paths
- Pre-launch risk analysis

---

## Philosophy

Most protocols do not fail because of obvious exploits.

They fail when execution assumptions break under real network conditions.

Boundary Labs studies how systems behave outside ideal testing environments.

---

## Research Approach

Focus is placed on identifying failure conditions rather than isolated bugs.

Analysis typically examines:

- execution flow under real network conditions
- assumptions between validation and execution
- griefing and denial-of-service surfaces
- edge cases that appear outside controlled testing environments

The goal is to understand how systems behave when assumptions break.
